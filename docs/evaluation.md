# Evaluation of work and product

### What user tests have you done? How did they affect the development of your product?
I did some thinking out load user tests on my prototypes. When letting a tester interact with the product and let they say what the want about it gives a lot of insights about what a potential user would do on the website. It also helped me to spot problems about the website so I could refactor and fix the parts that needed to fix. 

I noticed that many testers didn't click any of the links in i.e. the footer since there was no direct way to see the difference between regular text and a link. Therefor I added some hover and an underline on every link on the website.

### What images did you make, and with what techniques? Where did you find images if you use images that you didn't create? How did you make sure to adhere to copyright laws?
The images that are being posted with articles on Devblog is not Devblogs responsibility. If a user uploads an article with an image that contains. What I wanted to do was write a Terms of Use for the Devblog platform where I explain that everything violating the copyright law should be mailed to me and potentially taken down.

### WCAG - how have you made your website accessible?
When testing the website for accessibility I used some tools to speed up the testing. Although with the tools I used they cannot entirely determine whether the website is accessible (that can only be accomplished through a human assistant), these tools saved me some time and effort.

* Color Oracle
I used Color Oracle since it simulates various forms of colorblindness by adding a full-screen filter. I could choose different forms of color blindness: deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia. I noticed that some colors became less obvious when having the deuteranopia filter on, so I quickly changed that to a more _eye catching_ color.

* WAVE
This program is designed to facilitate web accessibility testing by providing developers with a visual representation of issues directly on their page. The tests assess a ton of accessibility issues, ranging from color contrast to ARIA attributes, and are based on compliance standard from WCAG.

Here's a screenshot of the program running:

I could quickly fix these errors and make my site more accessible.

### What have you learned about the process of making a website? What would you improve for next time? What would you improve about the website itself?

I have learned that if you plan out something more in detail the outcome will be greater. For example when creating an IA and a graphic profile the design and structure of the website felt more consistent and just better. I also learned to plan a project with a mix of scrum and kanban on Trello. 

I've also started to value user tests since they give a lot of insight how a regular user would navigate and use the website. Since I am the creator of the website everything feels crystal clear, but for someone that has never seen the website before it will not be too clear. User tests are also something that I will use in future projects.
