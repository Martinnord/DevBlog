# Thinking out loud user-test on Devblog's website #2

QnA subject: Tobias Carlsson

Before the user test, I prepared some questions to ask. I tried to give the tester as much freedom as possible to let him use the site as he would without my commands.

### What was your first impression of this website?
- It looks good, but it feels like a lot of the space is not used.
- It's too much white and it feels empty in some way.
- But I also like that there's not too much stuff on the website since it makes it easier to see all of the funcitons.

### What do you feel is the purpose of this website?
- As I can see on the name of the website I assume it's some sort of blogging platform, it also has the word _dev_ in the title which indicates it has something to do with developer or developing. 

- I also see that there's a bunch of articles in a feed as soon as I entered this website so I can with confident conclude that it's some sort of blogging platform.

### Who is the intended audience?
- I belivie it's for anyone who are coding or maybe getting into it. 

### Did you find what you are looking for?
- It wasn't too clear that you could click on the userame in the navbar since it's all white
- I would also suggest adding some sort of background color to make it easier to see that there's actually a navbar there. Otherwise it's pretty easy to navigate.

### Name four things that you loved most about the site?
- It's simplicity. Since there's not too much on the site I feel it's super easy to find all the functions that you can interact with.

### Name something that you hated/ disliked about the site
- Use some sort of greyish color as a background so the post-cards pop out more. Since I really don't like the unused space.

### Name something youâ€™d like to see on this site
 - That you navigates to profile page after successfully updated profile
