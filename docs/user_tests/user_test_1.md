# User test 1
Before the user test I prepered some questions to ask. I tried to give the tester as much fredom as possible to let him use the site as he would without my commands.

Here are the questions and the answers:

**What was your first impression of this website?**

It looks good, but it feels like most of the space aren't used. It's too much white and it feels empty in some way. But I also like that there's not too much UI which makes it easier to see all of the functions.

**What do you feel is the purpose of this website?**

As I can see on the name of the website I assume it's some sort of blogging platform, it also has the word _dev_ in the title which indicates it has something to do with developer or developing.

I also see that there's a bunch of articles in a feed as soon as I entered this website so I can with confident conclude that it's some sort of blogging platform.

**Who is the intended audience?** 

I belivie it's for anyone who are coding or maybe getting into it. 

**Did you find what you are looking for?** 

It wasn't too clear that you could click on the userame in the navbar since it's all white, so I would suggest adding some sort of background color to make it easier to see that there's actually a navbar there. Otherwise it's pretty easy to navigate.

**Name four things that you loved most about the site?**
It's simplicity. Since there's not too much on the site I feel it's super easy to find all the functions that you can interact with.

**Name something that you hated/ disliked about the site**
Use some sort of greyish color as a background so the post-cards pop out more. Since I really don't like the unused space.

**Name something youâ€™d like to see on this site.**
That you navigates to profile page after successfully updated profile
