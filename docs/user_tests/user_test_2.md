# Thinking out loud user-test on Devblog's website #2
(http://devblog.vyralynn.com/)

QnA subject: Adam Lindqvist

Before the user test, I prepared some questions to ask. I tried to give the tester as much freedom as possible to let him use the site as he would without my commands.

### What was your first impression of this website?
- It has something to do with computers.
- It might be something about martins life as a developer.
- The site feels very simple and focus only on the articles in this feed.

### What do you feel is the purpose of this website?
- The subjects initial though was about daily struggles of being a developer.
- But after the subject saw another name on an article the subject realized that this is a forum about computers and developers.

### Who is the intended audience?
- Developers, programmers.
- People interested in programming or want to get into it.

### Did you find what you are looking for?
I asked the subject to try to make an account on the website.
The subject found it very easy to create a new account since there's a button in the navbar that says _signup_. The subject clicks on the button which later takes the subject to the _signup route_. 

The subject later says, "_That was easy_".

### Name four things that you loved most about the site?
- I really like the good strucure of the website.
- The pictures of the articles is really great, since it gives good insight of what I'm about to read.
- When you read an article the fonts are mixed. Which makes it easier to distinguish the different yupe of headers, code blocks, etc.

### Name something that you hated/ disliked about the site
- The subject points out that the font with sarif is not supposed to be used on computers, but on papers.

### Name something youâ€™d like to see on this site.
- Some sort of navigation system when reading an article.

- re-type password so I am ceratin that the password is correct, or have a button to see the password that has been written correctly. 

- Be able to see articles that you have liked.

- See if the highlighted text has been styled. Some sort of indicator on the pop-up menu.

- Make `Back to devblog` on /404 button bigger so you can easier see the it and navigate back.

### Other thoughts

- Add hover effect on links.

# QnA usertest #2 results - analysis

I will be writing the more discussion based questions and try to analyze them. Some questions will be disclosure since I don't feel the need to discuss them because they speak for themselves.

### What was your first impression of this website?

The subject understood that the website is about computers due to the article covers on the page. But since the latest articles (those who fits on the screen) were all written by Martin the subject thought that this page was Martin's journal.

That is easy to fix since when the site gains popularity and users the names on the articles will be mixed and won't misguide any visitors that the page is a personal blog. 

The subject also thought that this site was very well structured and simple to use since there's not too much on the page. The focus lays on the most important things, which are the articles. 

### What do you feel is the purpose of this website?

The subject first thought this site was about Martin's life as a developer, but quickly realized that it was about writing articles when the subject saw other peoples name on the website. 

So, there's not too much you can fix on the UI aspect here, but rather on getting different people to write articles. So future visitors understand that this website is to write articles and not read some developers blog.


### Who is the intended audience?
Since the title of every article is about programming and the websites name contains _dev_ the subject quickly realized that this page is about developers/ programmers/ coders etc. 

This is a very good thing since the user won't have to search on this site to find its meaning, but rather ask himself/ herself if him/her want to stay on this developer community driven site.

### Did you find what you are looking for?
Here I asked the subject to create an account which the subject did very easily. Since the subject wasn't already logged in the navbar just displays two large buttons that say _Login_ and _Signup_.

This gave the subject a really fast navigation route to the signup page where the subject signed up. "The email, username, and password fields were easy to understand and the big blue signup button shows where to press after everything has been field", says the subject. 

This shows that changing the navbars UI for non-logged in users to easily login is a good idea.
