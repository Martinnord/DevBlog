# Prototype 1

These are the first sketches/ protoypes of the website. My goal was to have a very minimalist feel and give attention to the things that mattered the most. Like the articles and all the function that Devblog has to offer.

From the start, I already had a clear vision of what the platform would look like. I must admit that I stole some designs from other platforms (_steal like an artist_). 

Therefore it was not too hard to start prototyping.
