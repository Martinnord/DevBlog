# Devblog

## Purpose
The purpose of the work was to create a platform where developers can share their knowledge with other people by writing articles about programming. There are already pages like Medium.com where people can write articles about any principle, but it does make it difficult to find something similar.
Instead of having multiple topics becoming overwhelming, there is a narrow focus on programming on the platform.

  
## Project goals

* Get a feed of articles

* Log in and create an account

* Being able to create, update and delete articles (your own articles of course)

* Having a rich text editor that gives the user functionalities which enables them to change the style of the text while writing it

* Being able to like other peoples post

* Design an intuitive UI and easy to use functions
